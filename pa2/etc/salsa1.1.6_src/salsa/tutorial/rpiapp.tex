\chapter{Name Server Options and System Properties}\label{nameserverop}
  \section{Name Server Options}
    The name server can be run with several arguments. Running the name server 
    with the command {\tt -h} provides all the possible options.\\
    {\tt java wwc.naming.NamingServer -h
	  \begin{description}
	  \item {usage:
		\begin{description}
		\item java ...WWCNamingServer
		\item java ...WWCNamingServer -h
		\item java ...WWCNamingServer -v
		\item java ...WWCNamingServer -p portNumber
		\end{description}
	  }
	  \item {options:
		\begin{description}
		\item -h: Print this message.
		\item -v: Print version number.
		\item -p portNumber: Set the listening port to portNumber. Default port number is $3030$.
		\end{description}                  
	  }
	  \end{description} 
	}

  \section{System Properties}
	
	{SALSA programs can be executed with a set of system properties:
	  {\tt
		\begin{description}
		\item -Dport=<port number>: To specify the port number that the 
                 automatically started theater will listen to. Otherwise, a random port number is used.
		\item -Didentifier=<id>: To specify the relative locator of the bootstrapping actor's UAL.
		\item -Duan = <uan>: To specify the UAN of the bootstrapping actor.
		\item -Dual= <ual>: To specify the UAL of the bootstrapping actor.
		\item -Dnogc: The local garbage collector will not be triggered
		\item -Dgcverbose: To show the behavior of local GC
		\item -Dnodie: Making a dynamically created theater alive
		\end{description}
	  }
	}
    {
		Here comes the example: \begin{description}
		\item {\tt java -Dport = 5050 -Didentifier = actor/hello HelloWorld}
		\end{description}
	}
    {
		A theater is started at the current host (e.g. {\tt europa.wcl.cs.rpi.edu}).
		The dynamically created theater listens on port $5050$, and 
		the {\tt HelloWorld} actor has the UAL:  \begin{description}
		\item {\tt rmsp://europa.wcl.cs.rpi.edu:5050/actor/hello}
		\end{description}
	}

\chapter{Debugging Tips}\label{DebuggingTips} {
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure you really understand the actor model, its message passing semantics, and
the concurrency coordination abstractions built in SALSA. 

\item Message passing and remote procedure
calls are totally different. A named token variable does not have the 
result immediately. It has the result only after the message gets 
executed.

\item Objects in messages have pass-by-value semantics. This means that object arguments are
cloned and then sent. A latter modification on these object arguments does not change
the objects which were originally sent. 

\item Since the SALSA compiler does not support type checking in this version,
you may need to go through the Java source code. The code related to your
program is on the bottom of the generated Java source code. Do not try 
to modify other parts irrelevant to your SALSA source code.

\item Please note that a typo in a message sending statement does not
generate Java or SALSA compile-time errors. You have to be very careful with that.
A run-time error will be generated instead.

\item Most people confuse {\tt self} with {\tt this}. {\tt this} means "this actor", 
while {\tt self} "the actor reference" pointing to itself. {\tt self} can only be used 
as a target of messages, or an argument to be passed around. {\tt this} can be used for 
object method invocation. To send your references to other actors,
use  {\tt self}. Using {\tt this} is wrong.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{OverView: Generic Visualization of Dynamic Distributed Systems}\label{OverViewVisualization}
\section{OverView Introduction}
OverView is a toolkit for visualization of distributed systems, and is designed to be generic 
(that is, able to be applied to many different distributed systems), scalable 
(that is, to scale up to very large distributed systems), and dynamic 
(that is, functioning as well online as it does offline).
OverView is written in Java and is designed to work with any arbitrary Java system 
via a custom unintrusive profiling mechanism and a simple declarative language 
(called the Entity Specification Language) which describes how to map Java method invocations 
into a high-level description of visualization events. 
Figure \ref{heatExample} shows how OverView visualizes an actor creation event.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.3]{heatavi1.eps}
&
\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.3]{heatavi2.eps}
&
\includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.3]{heatavi3.eps}
\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{The three figures, from left to right, were captured from OverView when an actor was created.
In OverView, a rectangle container represents a theater, a circle object represents an actor,
and a line represents an event of message delivery.}
\label{heatExample}
\end{figure}

\emph{Please note that OverView requires Java 1.5 to compile and run.}

\section{Using OverView in SALSA}
The quickest way to start using OverView in SALSA is to simply download the
latest OverView and instrumented SALSA binary, which can be found at:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/overview/}
\end{description}

You should download {\tt overview<version>.jar} and {\tt salsa<version>i.jar}, and 
place them in a convenient location.

Then, all you need do to start using OverView is to ensure that the .jar file is 
in your Java classpath, either by placing it in your CLASSPATH environment variable. For example, 
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt CLASSPATH=.:/path/to/overviewX.X.X.jar }
\end{description}

You can specify the Java classpath by including it from the java command line:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt java -cp .:/path/to/overviewX.X.X.jar}
\end{description}

Now, using OverView is a two-step process. First, you need to write an Entity Specification Language file, 
which is used to map Java method invocations into OverView events. 
\emph{If you just want to see the default events that the instrumented SALSA binary provides, 
you do not need to write the Entity Specification Language file!}
The ESL format can be found at the overview official web site. 
Once writing it, you should run 
java overview.ovi.OverViewInstrumenter on that ESL file, from the toplevel directory of your project.
\emph{If you have downloaded the instrumented SALSA binary, you can skip the above phase!}
 
OverView will examine the ESL file and instrument your existing Java bytecode to send events over a port. 
Other than that, your program remains unchanged. The second step consists of running your program and 
starting to listen to it:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt  java overview.ovp.OverViewPresenter}
\end{description} 
 
This is easiest to do by starting your 
java program with the {\tt -DovPause} command line switch (so that it will wait for OVP before executing).

If you would like to test OverView to ensure that it works, it comes with a couple test programs. 
Before doing anything, you will need an OverView Daemon running, to relay events. To start one, try:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt  java overview.ovd.OverViewDaemon}
\end{description} 

Take note of the port that OVD is running on. Then, you should start a client, so you can visualize events as they happen:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt  java overview.ovp.OverViewPresenter localhost:6060}
\end{description} 

Replace, of course, {\tt localhost} with whatever particular host you're running OverView on. 
This should open an empty window that will display events. Finally, run your program:
{\sloppy
Take note of the port that OVD is running on. Then, you should start a client, so you can visualize events as they happen:
\begin{description}
  \item {\tt  java -DovHost=localhost:6060 overview.examples.fibonacci.Fibonacci 8 }
\end{description} 
}

You should begin to see a visualization of the sequence of Fibonacci numbers being calculated recursively.

\chapter{History of SALSA}
SALSA has been developed since 1998 by Carlos A. Varela, who was a Ph.D. student directed by Gul Agha at
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). During the UIUC period, Gregory Haik, a student of Gul Agha, 
has contributions to the naming service of the very early SALSA. 
Carlos A. Varela founded the Worldwide Computing Laboratory and continued the development of SALSA
when he became a faculty member at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2001.
Many of his students have participated in the SALSA project since then,
including Wei-Jen Wang,
Travis Desell, Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Jason LaPorte,
Abe Stephens, and Robin Toll.
Abe Stephens and Travis Desell were the major contributors of the early version of SALSA at RPI.
They worked together from 2001 until Abe Stephens graduated. Robin Toll has helped 
the early SALSA compiler during this period of time.
From 2003 to 2004, Travis Desell has committed a thoroughly change on the early SALSA, which then became the
foundation of the current version of SALSA. Advanced features such as message properties, 
name tokens, and join block continuations were introduced at that time. 
Wei-Jen Wang and Kaoutar El Maghraoui joined the SALSA project since 2003.
Kaoutar El Maghraoui has major contributions to the development of the communication layer of 
the latest SALSA.
Wei-Jen Wang has been a major developer since 2004. 
He made another major change on SALSA in 2004 and released it in 2005. 
He introduced actor garbage collection,
fault-tolerance communication using persistent sockets and messages, 
actor name deletion support for naming services, and passing-by-value message delivery.      
Jason LaPorte joined the SALSA project in 2006. His contributions relate to  
the interface between SALSA and the OverView project.
